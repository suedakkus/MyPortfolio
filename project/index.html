            Hello! I'm Sueda, a passionate student in web development and mobile
            app development. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            for web development, and I have practical experience in Android app
            development through an internship at a defense industry company. I'm
            actively working on creating my own portfolio website to further
            enhance my skills in these two areas. Here are the details:

            <h2>Android Mobile App Development</h2>
            <p>
              During my defense industry internship, I developed multiple
              Android applications using Android Studio, including a weather app
              with my design. Extensive use of Java during this period, coupled
              with university courses, strengthened my skills. Actively pursuing
              continuous improvement in Android app development, I offer a solid
              foundation for innovative, user-friendly solutions. Eager to
              contribute to projects and open to learning, feel free to contact
              for more information!

            <h2>Web Development</h2>
            <p>
              Currently in my third year of studies, I'm learning fundamental
              web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In the
              process, I am creating my own portfolio website to reinforce the
              knowledge I've gained and apply it to real-world projects.
              Starting with HTML and CSS, I have honed my skills in page layout
              and design. Additionally, I'm learning to incorporate interactive
              and dynamic elements using JavaScript. I am motivated and ready to
              create modern and impressive websites for you.

                <h1>Cannoli</h1>
                <h2>an Italian Restaurant</h2>
                <p>
                  While creating this project, I drew inspiration from an
                  authentic Italian restaurant called Cannoli. Developed as my
                  school's final project, this work encompasses an interactive
                  digital menu for restaurant customers and a pricing update
                  system for restaurant authorities. In this project,
                  implemented using the Java programming language, I focused on
                  delivering a modern and user-friendly digital menu to
                  customers. Simultaneously, I provided restaurant authorities
                  with a tool to update menu prices. The simple yet effective
                  design, developed through the NetBeans application, ensures a
                  seamless experience for both customers and restaurant
                  authorities. You can access and review the source code of this
                  project through the following GitHub link.

                <h1>Weather App</h1>
                <h2>Android Mobile application</h2>
                <p>
                  Weather App, the project I named, was my first Android
                  application developed during my voluntary internship to gain
                  experience in the field of Android mobile development. I
                  brought this project to life using Java language and Android
                  Studio, and it incorporates entirely my own design. Weather
                  App became a project where I learned and experimented with
                  everything I needed for Android app development. Throughout my
                  internship, I had the opportunity to apply the knowledge I
                  gained to this application. I haven't uploaded it to my GitHub
                  account or the Google Play Store yet because I need to make a
                  few more touches. However, I plan to complete these steps soon
                  and make my project accessible to everyone. You can find

          <h2>Software Engineer</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Sueda , a 3rd-year student at Nişantaşı University.
            During the first two years of my academic journey, I immersed myself
            in Java education. At the beginning of my second year, I
            participated in a game camp called Digiage organized by Bilişim
            Vadisi. I had the opportunity to gain practical experience in
            Android mobile development during a voluntary internship at a
            defense industry company named Delsa. Currently, I am actively
            pursuing education in the field of Web development, continuously
            enhancing my skills. My goal is to delve into Full Stack Development
            after accumulating knowledge in all targeted areas. Through a
            combination of experiences in both mobile app development and web
            technologies, I am working towards becoming a versatile developer.
            By merging the insights gained from education, internships, and
            projects, I aim to contribute to more significant and innovative
            ventures in the future. If you'd like to learn more about me or
            explore the details of my projects, please feel free to get in
